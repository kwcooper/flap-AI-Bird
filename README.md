# Flap(AI) Bird

Artificial intelligence playing a Python Port of the famous Flappy Bird game. We used genetic algorithms to train neural networks for each bird, which quickly learns how to jump, even on non deterministic pipes, after about 30 generations, the bird can play as well as the average human. After a few hundred, the bird quickly becomes superhuman. 
Also included is a supervised neural network and training data pulled from a hardcoded bird (70 pipe average).

### Installing
This code should run on any machine, with pygame being the biggest bottleneck on that front.
As always with python, we recomend using pip to install packages. 

1. Install Python 2.7.X or 3.5.x from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/)

2. Install PyGame 1.9.X from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

3. Grab this repo

4. Run `python flappy.py` from the repo's directory


Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Example Use

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

 use <kbd>p;</kbd> key to pause and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
