# Flap(AI) Bird

Artificial inteligence playing a Python Port of the famous Flappy Bird game. We used genetic algorithms to train neural networks for each bird, which quickly learns how to jump, even on undeterministic pipes, after about 30 generations, the bird can play as well as the average human. After a few hundred, the bird quickly becomes superhuman. 
Also included is a supervised neural network and training data pulled from a hardcoded bird wich could average about 70 pipes.

### Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

### Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
As always with python, we recomend using pip to install packages. 

1. Install Python 2.7.X or 3.5.x from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/)

2. Install PyGame 1.9.X from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

3. Grab this repo

4. Run `python flappy.py` from the repo's directory


Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Example Use

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

 use <kbd>p;</kbd> key to pause and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
